# Tesla Stock Price Forecasting using LSTM

This project applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast Tesla’s stock closing price over a 21-day horizon. The model is trained on historical stock price data and designed to capture time-dependent patterns, enabling accurate short-term predictions that can support trading strategies, risk management, and scenario analysis.

## 📊 Performance
- **MAPE:** 4.47%
- **R² Score:** 0.9871  

These results indicate strong model performance for short-term forecasting.

## 🚀 Features
- LSTM architecture implemented using TensorFlow/Keras  
- Data preprocessing, scaling, and prediction pipeline  
- Visualizations: price trends, daily returns, volume, forecast with confidence bands
